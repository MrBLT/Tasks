 *      Description: PID module to adjust duty cycle for a heater to control temperature
 *
 *      Notes:	This module will continuously calculate an error value (e) as
 *      	the difference between a desired temperature (Setpoint SP) and a
 *      	current temperature (Process Variable PV). The module will attempt
 *      	to minimize the error over time by adjusting the duty cycle (Manipulated
 *      	Variable MV) using a weighted sum.

 *      Inputs:
